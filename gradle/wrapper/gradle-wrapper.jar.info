To get the actual gradle-wrapper.jar file, you can:

   ```
   gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
   ```

2. Or download it from a working Gradle project

3. Or use the Gradle Wrapper task in your IDE

The gradle-wrapper.jar file should be placed in this directory (gradle/wrapper/) and is required for the Gradle Wrapper to function properly.
